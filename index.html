            <h2>Why Peruvian Food is the best</h2>
            <p> Peruvian gastronomy earns its title as the world's best due to the powerful confluence of its unmatched biodiversity and ingredient richness, spanning over 3,000 native potato varieties to Amazonian superfoods like lúcuma, with its profound cultural fusion (culinary mestizaje). This rich historical blending which incorporates indigenous, Spanish, African, Chinese (chifa), and Japanese (nikkei) influences has given rise to an unparalleled variety of iconic dishes such as Ceviche, Lomo Saltado, and Ají de Gallina. Ultimately, the Innovation of World-Class Chefs, like those leading Central and Maido to the top of global rankings, has taken this extraordinary pantry and tradition elevating Peruvian cooking into an award winning art form recognized worldwide.</p>

Figures like Gastón Acurio, Virgilio Martínez or Mitsuharu Tsumura, whoses restaurants Central and Maido has been recognized as the best in the world, have consistently placed Peru on the international rankings.</p>
